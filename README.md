# Advent of Code 2018

This are my implementations for the 2018 Advent of Code.

## Test

All implementations are unit tested. Just run:

```
cargo test
```

## Run

Just run the program with cargo:

```
cargo run
```

You will be asked for a puzzle to run. You just have to enter the number of a day with an implementation.

```
Puzzle to run: 1
1:1 — Frequency: 525
1:2 — Repeating frequency: 75749
```
